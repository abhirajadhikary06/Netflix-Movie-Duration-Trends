# 📊 Netflix Movie Duration & Genre Trends Analysis

Welcome to the **Netflix Movie Duration Trends** project! This repository analyzes trends in movie durations and genre production across different release years on Netflix. With insights from two key graphs: one that tracks **Average Duration vs. Release Year**, and another that examines the **Number of Movies per Genre vs. Release Year**, this project provides an interactive exploration of changing audience preferences over time. 📈📉

## Key Graphs and Insights

### 1️⃣ **Graph 1: Average Duration vs. Release Year**
This graph reveals the shift in the duration of movies over the decades:
- Between **1960 and 1970**, there was a noticeable increase in the average duration of movies, possibly indicating a trend toward longer, more elaborate storytelling.
- After the 1970s, the **average duration started to decline**, suggesting a movement towards shorter films in later decades.
- A potential correlation emerges between the **decline in duration** and the **rise of Anime Feature films**, which tend to have shorter runtimes compared to traditional live-action films.

### 2️⃣ **Graph 2: Release Year vs. Number of Movies per Genre**
This graph highlights the dynamics of genre popularity over time:
- **Drama** has historically been the most produced genre. However, there was a **sharp decline** in drama films from 2020 to 2021, possibly due to a shift in audience preferences.
- A notable **surge in Anime Feature films** is seen during the same period, as audiences gravitated towards this genre.
- Genres like **Comedies, Documentaries,** and **Action** films also experienced a dip in production during 2020, coinciding with the rise in Anime Feature content.
- The **Documentary** genre, in particular, has seen consistent growth from 2012 onwards, reflecting an increasing interest in real-world narratives.

### 📊 **Interactive Graph**
An additional interactive graph allows users to select specific genres and explore the number of movies produced over the years for each genre. This provides an even deeper insight into trends across different categories.

## 📖 Conclusion
The analysis indicates a growing preference for **concise storytelling formats**, possibly influenced by the rising popularity of **Anime Feature films**, which often have shorter runtimes. As a result, the overall average length of movies has decreased, while maintaining narrative quality.
